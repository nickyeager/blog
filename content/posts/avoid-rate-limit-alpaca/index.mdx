# Strategies for avoiding alpaca markets rate limits

Creating a stock screener via rest api calls is both difficult and potentially expensive.

Thankfully, we can use the numpy function `split_array` to split an array down the middle.

```
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi
import numpy as np
tickers = tradeapi.polygon.all_tickers() # this returns roughly 9,000 tickers as of the publishing date
totalPrice = 0
split_array = np.array_split(tickers, 200)
        for stocks in enumerate(split_array):
            bars = self.alpaca.get_barset(stocks, 'minute', 1)
            for symbol in bars:
              if (bars[symbol]):
                symbol_bars = bars[symbol]
                if (symbol_bars):
                    totalPrice += symbol_bars[0].c
                    print('totalPrice' + ' ' + str(totalPrice))
```

We first query to get a stock "Universe", then break apart the array into sub arrays with 200 elements each (the maximum number we're allowed to query based on the alpaca library syntax).
We can then iterate through the minute bar results.

This allows us to stay under the 200 stock per minute rate limit.
